                                <p>Tens of thousands of mourners from across China flocked to the funeral of <strong>Yuan Longping</strong> in the central city of Changsha on Monday in a spontaneous outpouring of public grief for the agronomist and national hero known as “the father of hybrid rice”.</p>
                                <p>Millions more paid their last respects at a state-sanctioned virtual funeral held online for Yuan after he died of organ failure aged 90 on Saturday (May 22, 2021), a beloved figure credited with saving tens of millions from hunger in China as well as developing countries across Asia and Africa.</p>
                                <p>The scale of mass mourning was reminiscent of the funerals of only a few Chinese leaders in modern history, and the crowds of grieving younger people underscored the deep regard for him across generations.</p>

                                <p>Mr. Yuan made two major discoveries in hybrid rice cultivation.Those discoveries, in the early 1970s — together with breakthroughs in wheat cultivation in the ’50s and ’60s by Norman Borlaug, an American plant scientist — helped create the Green Revolution of steeply rising harvests and an end to famine in most of the world.</p>
